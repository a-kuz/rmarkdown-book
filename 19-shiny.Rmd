To clarify your expenses, on 02/01 a charge of 700‚Ç¨ was made on your card. Including the current expenses which total approximately 130‚Ç¨, your remaining balance seems to be 29,59‚Ç¨. It is important to ensure that all transactions including charges, refunds, and pending transactions are accounted for. To fully understand the discrepancy, I suggest a review of your account's transaction history to track all activity that has affected your balance.
